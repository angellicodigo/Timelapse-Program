# Timelapse Program
My program for my IB HL CS class. My client created a program called "Facecode" that aligns multiple selfies using facial detection. His program can be seen in his personal website: https://www.christiancardozo.com/personalprojects. His program takes in a picture and outputs an edited photo, thus he has folders of images he wants to easily be created into a video. My program serves such purpose by being able to change the dimensions of the photo, select and delete photos, and change the frames-per-second (FPS) of the video.<br>

Future improvements include being able to input other file formats, like ZIP and RAR, having a restore point incase the program crashes, and more features!
